Liberator
=========

Why?
----

Do you work for the Department of Defense? 
Or maybe `colleagues.enlightments.all? [:vim, :git, :github]`?

Either way, you're stuck at work, but have no GitHub.

Never fear! Liberator is here!

Disclaimer

This is still really alpha stuff. I just needed to scratch an itch
and find a home away from home to browse some code.

You're not supposed to use this code. You have been warned.

This is a paltry ripoff of some of the best parts of GitHub.

If any GitHubbers are reading this, I hope you'll forgive me.
It has all been for The Greater Goodâ„¢.
